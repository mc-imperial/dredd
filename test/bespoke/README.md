Dredd *execute* tests
=====================

There is one subdirectory per test.

Each subdirectory must contain:

- `test.py` - a Python script that should return if and only if the test is successful.

- Any other files required to support the bespoke test.

See the script that runs `bespoke` tests to see how these tests are invoked.
